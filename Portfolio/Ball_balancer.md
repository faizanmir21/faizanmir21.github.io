# Ball-Balancer
The Ball-Balancing system is a SISO system that uses PID to control the ball's position on a plate. 
By adjusting the plate we set the acceleration of the ball and move it towards a reference position. 
Because the axes are uncoupled we can implement 2 independent controllers to control both the x and y position of the ball.
